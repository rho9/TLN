# Word Sense Disambiguation
The aim of this project is to implement Lesk algorithm. It is used to disambiguate polysemic terms within the sentences of `sentences.txt` file. The project returns the synset IDs of the meaning (appropriate for the context) and it rewrites each input sentence by replacing the polysemic term with the list of synonyms possibly present in the synset.
